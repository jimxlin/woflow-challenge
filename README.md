# Woflow Assessment - Nodes on Nodes Challenge

Completed by Jim Lin (miljinx@gmail.com) on 2022-11-04 for Woflow.

Used Ruby (version 2 or greater).

1. **What is the total number of unique node IDs?**

There are __30__ unique node IDs.

2. **What is the most common node ID?**

The most common node ID is __a06c90bf-e635-4812-992e-f7b1e2408a3f__. I am interpreting "common" to mean the node with the most edges.
